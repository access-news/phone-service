%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% `info` clauses (for FreeSWITCH events) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Rationale for using `handle_event_function` callbacks {{- {{-
%% =====================================================
%%
%% Using `handle_event_function` callback mode as it is
%% the most straightforward way to massage all incoming
%% FreeSWITCH  events  (emitted by  `mod_erlang_event`)
%% into a  form that  is easier  to pattern  match (see
%% below and the specific steps for more).
%%
%% ### Mostly `info` type `gen_statem` events
%%
%% FreeSWITCH events are sent as regular messages, hence they are handled by matching on `info` type `gen_statem` events in the callbacks. With `state_functions`, the `info` events would have needed checking in every state, and a macro could have been used to type less, but it would have become cluttered nonetheless.
%%
%% Using _inserted events_ (or _stored events_) to add an event pre-processing step via the `{next_event, EventType, EventContent}` **transition action**. `gen_statem` also ensures that ["_the stored events are inserted in the queue as the next to process before any already queued events. The order of these stored events is preserved, so the first next_event in the containing list becomes the first to process._"](https://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_statem.html#type-action).
%%
%% TODO: Update https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/statem.html#Inserted%20Events with the above quote from the `gen_statem` man page.
%%
%% ```erl
%% %% `state_functions` pseudo-code
%%
%% incoming_call(info, ModErlEventMsg, _Data) ->
%%     MassagedModErlEvent = do_the_deed,
%%     {keep_state_and_data, {next_event, internal, MassagedModErlEvent}};
%% incoming_call(internal, MassagedFSEvent, Data) ->
%%     do_something_here,
%%     {next_state, ...}.
%%
%% %% ... N more other states
%%
%% publication(info, ModErlEventMsg, _Data) ->
%%     MassagedModErlEvent = do_the_deed,
%%     {keep_state_and_data, {next_event, internal, MassagedModErlEvent}};
%% publication(internal, MassagedFSEvent, Data) ->
%%     do_something_here,
%%     {next_state, ...}.
%% ```
%%
%% With `handle_event_function` there is only one callback, `handle_event/4`, so there is only one pre-processing clause is needed (for `info` `gen_statem` events).
%%
%% ### Event-focused approach
%%
%% An event-focused approach is justified (as opposed to a state-focused one above) by how FreeSWITCH events drive the IVR forward, resulting in the majority of `gen_statem` events to be of `info` event type.
%%
%% ### Clearer structure
%%
%% If casts and calls will ever be implemented, if external call control use case(s) would arise, they could have their own sections.
%%
%% ```erlang
%% %% `handle_event_function` pseudocode
%%
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% %% FreeSWITCH events %%
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% handle_event(info, ModErlEventMsg, _State, _Data) ->
%%     MassagedModErlEvent = do_the_deed,
%%     {keep_state_and_data, {next_event, internal, MassagedModErlEvent}};
%%
%% handle_event(internal, MassagedModErlEvent, State, Data) ->
%%     %% ...
%%     {next_state, ...}.
%%
%% handle_event(internal, MassagedModErlEvent, AnotherState, Data) ->
%%     %% ...
%%     {next_state, ...}.
%%
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% %% External commands %%
%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% handle_event(cast, ...) ->
%%
%% handle_event(call, ...) ->
%% ```
%%
%% ### Complex state
%%
%% An added bonus is to be able to use complex (or compound states). Apart from the IVR's state, also needed to track whether caller is authenticated or not, and `gen_statem` state is a nice place to put it. Otherwise it would live in `gen_statem`'s data or in the process registry.
%% }}- }}-

%% Step 1. Pre-process FreeSWITCH events {{- {{-
%% -------------------------------------
%% Convert all incoming FreeSWITCH events into a form that is easier to pattern match (in this case, a map).
%%
%% The `mod_erlang_event` format of `FSEventHeaders` is of
%% `[{HeaderString1, ValueString1}, ..., {HeaderStringN, ValueStringN}]`
%% , and the fastest way to parse that is using `proplists` function, and it can't be matched in function headers.
%% }}- }}-

%% TODO Once the  IVR is  implemented, filter out  FS events
%%      (and/or parts of the events) that are  irrelevant to
%%      lower overhead.

%% MOD_ERL_EVENT_MASSAGE (info) {{-
%% The   event  content   is   name  `ModErlEventMsg`   on {{- {{-
%% purpose, and not  `FSEvent` (i.e., FreeSWITCH event)
%% or   similar,  because   `mod_erlang_event`  creates
%% its  own  arbitrary  messages  and  wrappers  around
%% FreeSWITCH  events. Most  are  consistent in  having
%% the form  of `{ModErlEventCallStatus,  {event, [UUID
%% |  FSEventHeaders]}}`  but there  is  `{call_hangup,
%% UUID}`,  even  though   there  are  `CHANNEL_HANGUP`
%% events received besides it.
%%
%% The   actual    FreeSWITCH   event    is   basically
%% `FSEventHeaders`,  as they  consist of  header-value
%% pairs anyways, and an optional body.
%%
%% TODO It is rare for FreeSWITCH events to have body (or is
%%      it?) and not sure how  the Erlang message looks like
%%      in that case.
