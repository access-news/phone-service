IDEAS FOR TRANSITIONING TO TR2

1. Local Changes

   a. READERS
      Replace headset phones in the recording booths to record
      digitally. One alternative would be to configure inexpensive
      Raspberry PIs that use the data ports on the wall instead of
      the phone ports.

   b. LISTENERS
      Only volunteers would be affected when implementing local
      changes.

2. Remote Changes

   a. READERS
      It is possible to recreate the same recording process that
      volunteers currently use to record through the phone system.

      Readers who record digitally tend to be more flexible based
      on their experience with technology. At this time there are
      many options to submit their recordings, such as email them,
      share an iCloud link, upload to Google Drive, etc. It is
      going to be a gradual process to accomodate each method,
      one at a time. One example is to integrate with IOS to allow
      the easier submission of Voice Memo app recordings, optimally
      with a push of a button.

      To keep this section short and relevant more out-there ideas
      are collected in "TR2-vision.txt".

   b. LISTENERS
      Keep using the replicated TR phone menu system or start exploring
      the online alternatives.

      Again, see "TR2-vision.txt" for more eccentric ideas.
