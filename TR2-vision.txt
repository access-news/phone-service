The ideas below are more in the realm of brainstorming that
accumulated during the last couple months. I will try to give this
document structure but some of the concepts are connected to other
topics as well. There would also be more technical description to
address some of my concerns or to just remember what I had in mind.

VISION

     TR2 could be the (or an) online audio aggregation point for the
     print-impaired community, providing access to
     * news sources

     * original content (podcasts, plays or something brand new)

     * 3rd party audio content sources by mirroring other popular
       audio content sites (collaboration opportunities)

     * federal, state, municipal etc government alerts, announcements,
       news, events

     It could be multilingual and multinational, serving minorities
     (e.g., hispanic, hmong, chinese, japanese).

     The service could be made available to the non-impaired for
     a fee that gets donated to non-profits or pay involved for profit
     services involved in the project.

     DISCUSS: * What would be the best course: use the TR distribution
                model and make the platform available to others to deploy
                the way they like, or a single online service that is
                built on tight collaboration?

              Personally, I prefer the latter because of a unified
              representation that could be a state-wide service but
              it would have it's challenges:

              * Would money-matters (grants, donations etc) interfere
                with the latter?

              * Operation? Committee?

              * How to coordinate collaboration?
                (non-profit, government, media, 3rd party etc.)
                This is also interesting from a technical
                viewpoint.


EASIER CONTRIBUTION

  1) Send the recording to the email address of the service as
     an attachment and a script reads the metadata and inserts the
     file into the system.

  2) Make short-term or periodic availability recording easier by
     not enforcing mandatory assignments. Assigning publications
     to a remote reader avoids duplication but it results in very
     poor utilization as sometimes only a couple articles get read
     in a month.

     So the notion is to make cherry-picking available for remote
     readers as well. Established readers could have the opportunity
     though to preserve a publication for themselves but this would
     come with extra responsibilities such as consistent number of
     articles recorded (e.g., three-fourth of a magazine) and high
     recording quality. See PLAYFULNESS and QUALITY sections.

     This way it would be possible to provide volunteer opportunities
     to students to complete their community service goals or volunteers
     who are trying out the service but may change their minds later. 

     Probably this would also result in a better quality service (or
     at least more consistent) because some publications get reserved
     for a remote reader but she may stop after the second week. After
     reaching out for her, she may start up again, but more often not,
     wasting the opportunity for someone else to read.

     IDEA:
       By collaborating with media sources (see COLLABORATION) or by
       using volunteer help, article stubs would be added from different
       publications and these could be picked by a prospective reader.
       Available and already read articles would be clearly highlighted.

       An article stub consists of a representation of the article on the
       web page (or mobile app) and a preliminary recording containing the
       title, author name, byline, date etc. The representation of an
       article could be a link, a scanned image of the printed version
       and so on.

       By selecting an article, the reader can either read the
       full article or opt in to only read the main content and the
       preliminary recording with the article details will be added
       automatically.

       DISCUSS: The former option is probably not a good idea
                if we would like to create a service with highly
                consistent content.

  3) Make it easier to create new categories and/or publications.

  4) Allow referral submission.
     For example, someone finds a good podcast that she thinks
     would be a great addition to the content.

  5) Integration with other platforms
     For example, Voice Memo is installed on the iPhones by default,
     therefore sharing that recording with TR2 could be just by
     pushing a button.


QUALITY

     Allowing easier contribution would require quality assurance
     (QA). By QA I mean audio quality and that recordings conform
     to common guidelines such as no hate speech, appropriate
     content etc. In addition, currently there is no QA process
     other than the Access News admin sampling some of the recording
     when there's time.

     QA could be achieved on multiple levels:

       * Using an automated script checking for "bubbles", distortion,
         etc.

       * Creating a new volunteer activity to check recordings.

         This could be one non-monetary(?) way for non-impaired users
         to access content. Although there would be strict conditions
         they would need to be adhere to.

         Impaired users would also be able to give voice to their
         opinion:

       * By getting feedback.
         This has to be easy enough and reachable from any part
         of the process (either in a mobile app or on the website).
