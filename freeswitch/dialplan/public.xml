<!--
    NOTICE:

    This context  is usually  accessed via  the external
    sip profile listening on port 5080.

    It  is  recommended  to have  separate  inbound  and
    outbound  contexts.   Not  only  for   security  but
    clearing up why  you would need to do  such a thing.
    You  don't  want  outside  un-authenticated  callers
    hitting  your default  context which  allows dialing
    calls thru your providers and results in Toll Fraud.
-->

<!-- TODO: clean up

     Because pretty sure that I'm overcomplicating things
     again. What is done right  now, is that the incoming
     call matches the last extension (public_extensions),
     and routes it to the internal `default` context. But
     this  system will  never  have users,  why not  just
     handle it here?

     Also,  when switching  to  ESL and  Elixir, the  Lua
     scripts will be gone too.

     UPDATE: `conf/dialplan/public/00_inbound_did`

             Actually,  this might  be  it, instead  of
             `default.xml`.
