The ideas below are more in the realm of brainstorming that
accumulated during the last couple months. I will try to give this
document structure but some of the concepts are connected to other
topics as well. There would also be more technical description to
address some of my concerns or to just remember what I had in mind.

VISION

     TR2 could be the (or an) online audio aggregation point for the
     print-impaired community, providing access to
     * news sources

     * original content (podcasts, plays or something brand new)

     * 3rd party audio content sources by mirroring other popular
       audio content sites (collaboration opportunities)

     * federal, state, municipal etc government alerts, announcements,
       news, events

     It could be multilingual and multinational, serving minorities
     (e.g., hispanic, hmong, chinese, japanese).

     The service could be made available to the non-impaired for
     a fee that gets donated to non-profits or pay involved for profit
     services involved in the project.

     DISCUSS: * What would be the best course: use the TR distribution
                model and make the platform available to others to deploy
                the way they like, or a single online service that is
                built on tight collaboration?

              Personally, I prefer the latter because of a unified
              representation that could be a state-wide service but
              it would have it's challenges:

              * Would money-matters (grants, donations etc) interfere
                with the latter?

              * Operation? Committee?

              * How to coordinate collaboration?
                (non-profit, government, media, 3rd party etc.)
                This is also interesting from a technical
                viewpoint.


EASIER CONTRIBUTION

  1) Send the recording to the email address of the service as
     an attachment and a script reads the metadata and inserts the
     file into the system.

  2) Make short-term or periodic availability recording easier by
     not enforcing mandatory assignments (i.e., at this time a remote
     reader is assigned a publication to avoid duplicates).
     This results in very poor utilization as sometimes only
     a couple articles get read in a month.

     IDEA:
       By collaboration with media sources (see COLLABORATION) or by
       volunteer help, article stubs would be added from different
       publications and these could be queried and selected whether
       they have been recorded or not.

       An article stub is consists of the representation of the article
       on the web page and a preliminary recording containing the title,
       author name, byline, date etc. The representation of an article
       could be a link, a scanned image of the printed version and so on.

       By selecting an article, the reader can either read the
       full article or opt in to only read the main content and the
       preliminary recording with the article details will be added
       automatically.

       DISCUSS: The former option is probably not a good idea
                if we would like to create a service with highly
                consistent content.
